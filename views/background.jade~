        h1 Background Information, Survey and Literature Review
        p
          | We are not a typical cryptic ICU data visualization system. Our innovation is novel, and it is an improvement upon various other ICU visualization tools out there. Other tools are hard to use. Ours is super easy to use.
        h2 Survey of existing technology
        br
        p
          | Before cooking up our visualization tool, we sat down and did a careful survey of existing technology. The review below summarizes our findings. Our review covers three (partially overlapping) areas: (1) visualization of raw clinical/ICU time series data, (2) results of machine learning classification and clustering with ICU data, and (3) interactive clustering and classification applications that attempt to address all of these problems.
        h4 <strong> Visualizing time series data </strong>
        p
          | A number of studies have attempted to visualize raw time series data in the clinical/ICU setting.  In a review paper by Rind et al. [6], 14 different tools for interactively visualizing clinical data are summarized.  For example, Lifelines [13] is an interactive visualization tool showing a patient\'s temporal history and integrates data similar to that found in the MIMIC-II database. However, these timelines are limited to individual patients and does not support aggregated patient views to explore patterns across multiple histories. One of the strengths of using the MIMIC-II database is that it allows us to build a retrospective, exploratory visualization revealing patterns from 30K patient histories that doctors can leverage in real-time. Many of these tools use stacks of univariate plots over time.  Ordonez [7] attempts to improve on this paradigm by using a novel spider-plot visualization.  However, users of his tool mentioned that it could more accurately and confidently identify patient diagnoses.
        
        h4 <strong> Machine Learning</strong>
        p
          | Many studies have been performed on clinical data using machine learning methods [5]. More specifically, some studies have used machine learning to predict mortality and ventilator failure in ICU patients [8,9].  Gotz et al. [10] explored clustering using selected medication and diagnostic features, but nobody has reported clustering for the MIMIC-II database. Ghassemi et al. [12] used the MIMIC-II database for predictive modeling of ICU patient mortality. Most notably, these models are augmented with clinical notes, which have been shown to increase the modelâs predictive power. However, no interactive or visual display of the results was produced to supplement the models, where we will deliver both. Further, this paper suggests the scientific value of these models lies in validating similar models for disease and mortality. In contrast, we want our tool to serve as a decision and knowledge aid for physicians directly.
        p
          | <strong>Interactive Tools</strong>
          br
          | There are some visualizations for other applications of medical data such as personal medical histories [13], lung transplant home monitoring [14], and glucose levels [15]. Mirador [18] is a newer tool that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of large data sets, but is not specific to clinical data. The idea of interactive visual clustering for non-clinical data has been addressed by Desjardins et al. [11]. The only visualization tool for ICU data is the Medical Information Visualization Assistant [16,17]. Unfortunately this tool suffers from âinformation overloadâ and only displays raw lab data, without any machine learning analytics or visualization.

        h2 Our method
        h4 <strong>Improvements on the current State-of-the-Art</strong>
        p
          | Our project has the following potential innovations: 1) Combination of visualization, timeline, clustering, and regression analysis as an interactive webtool; 2) novel results using the MIMIC-II data.  
        h4 <strong>Data</strong>
        p
          Data was collected from the MIMIC-II database (https://mimic.physionet.org/).  The MIMIC-II database is freely available and contains high temporal resolution data including lab results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms.  Data for 1000 patients was parsed into a .csv format in which mortality and ICD-Diagnosis statuses for over 1000 diagnoses (features) were represented as Boolean variables for each patient.  
        p
          We also computed features for 31 high risk comorbid conditions (known as Elixhauser Comorbidity Measures) [19], which were based upon aggregations of diagnostic codes (ICD-9 codes). These include comorbidities such as congestive heart failure, coagulopathies, neurological disorders, etc.  Again, a Boolean representation was used to indicate presence or absence of a comorbidity.  We used this set of 31 features to do univariate regression on each of these 31 features. Furthermore, we did multivariate regression on specific subsets of these 31 features. 
        h4 <strong>Interactive User Interface</strong>
        p
          | We created webpages using a combination of popular front end tools including JQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, and D3.js. We created views for the main page, the timelines, the clustering, and the regression. Some pictures of the views are shown in the figures below. We used Bower to install packages. All static code for front end stuff was stored in a directory branching off the root directory for the website . We are running the site on a t1.micro EC2 instance on Amazon AWS and are using node.js to run it. 
        p
                All associated pages for the site are linked from the home page. Javascript is leveraged in order to enhance the user experience with visually appealing elements such as animated scrolling, dropdown menus, and highlighted menus upon mouse rollover.
        h4 <strong>K-means clustering</strong>
        p 
          | The matrix of 1000 patients and 31 comorbidities (features) was used for clustering. Clustering analysis, data reduction, and visualization was performed in Matlab using built-in functions princomp and kmeans to perform principle component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering, respectively. The raw data was first standardized (centered and scaled) by subtracting the sample mean from each data point and then dividing by the sample standard deviation. Then, PCA analysis was performed on the standardized data and finally k-means clustering was performed to produce two patient clusters. Support for performing PCA before k-means clustering can be found in [20]. Clustered patient data were initially visualized using only the first two principle components for ease of viewing.
        h4 <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>
        p 
          | MATLAB was used to perform logistic regression.  Comorbidity and mortality data was read into a cell array using the textscan() function.  These values were converted to double type, and the glmfit() function was used with the distribution set to âbinomial.â 2x2 confusion matrices were also made for each of the 31 comorbidity features.
